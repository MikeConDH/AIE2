        "Templates can affect the evaluation metrics, which in turn is going impact the effort and time to complete an app to be acceptable to the customer.  Not all prompt priciples work the same.  Since I did not have time to review the actual responses, and only the metrics, I can't give a complete answer.  A couple of interesting attempts to increase the faithfulness did not work, it stayed at 5 every time.  The one that I expected to do poorly (#5) faired well.  I'm curious as to how expertise applications are being tested.\n",
